The PMSF folder should also be compatible with some popular reporting bots (hence some duplicate images and sub folders.)

Currently PMSF still uses some local static files (eggs, grunts etc) so you may want to manually replace some of the images you host locally inside the following PMSF folder

/PMSF/static/

Simply replace / rename any images you want from the Alternative Egg designs, grunts subfolder, or misc etc (eg Slider images for nests and stardust)

You may need to rebuild PMSF after replacing images, same as when you update your build.

npm install && npm run build


Any donations very welcome if you want to support my personal morale / upkeep of image repo's
